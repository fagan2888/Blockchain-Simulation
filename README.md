# Description
These files simulate a blockchain. Notably this
demo shows a simplification of some of the
harder to understand details in order to shed
light. Key elements that can be seen here:

  0. How Ethereum prevents double spending
  1. How the proof-of-work algorithm creates blocks
  2. How blocks are chained together
  3. How accounts update state
